⚑ Toronto, ON, Canada

⚑ https://ournetworks.ca/  

A conference about the past, present, and future of building our own network infrastructures. Our Networks will kickoff with social events on Friday July 13, the main focus is the conference on Saturday, Sunday July 14-15, and we will host project sprints Monday to Wednesday July 16-18.

The theme this year focuses on how we Do It With Others (DIWO) as opposed to just ourselves. 2017 saw a growing number of peer-to-peer, inclusive, and privacy-respecting projects, yet many challenges remain. In the face of threats to the open internet, which tools and tactics will help us respond to the opportunities of this moment? We are inviting proposals for talks, workshops, discussions, demonstrations and interventions to explore these questions. Topics could include, but in no way are limited to:  
▶︎ decentralisation is not enough  
▷ making equitable network infrastructures  
▶︎ rebuilding or repairing existing infrastructure  
▷ being/becoming network neighbours  
▶︎ skill- and capacity-building for maintaining alternative networks  

Deadline for proposals is April 30, 2018, check out our full call for participation for submission instructions: https://ournetworks.ca/2018

We are hosting an open hour call for people to ask questions about potential topics and the conference itself: Tuesday April 17 at 8:00-9:00 pm ET. No prior registration needed, just visit: https://appear.in/ournetworks

This event has a Code of Conduct: https://ournetworks.ca/code-of-conduct/ For any questions, please email us at orga@ournetworks.ca!
